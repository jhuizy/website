# Intro

I am a software developer from Perth, WA. I am insterested in all parts of the web development lifecycle, from spinning up infrastructure to UI design. I enjoy writing code in strongly typed, functional programming languages (okay, just Haskell) but have experience in a wide variety of languages and frameworks. I am most comfortable working from the CLI of either Mac OS or linux.
